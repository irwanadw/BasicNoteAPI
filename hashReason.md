hashPassword is a transform process of original password to random string with help of algoritm.Hash password is one way transform. Thats mean its really hard to decode random string back to original password.

## Reason
There is a two reason why we using hashpassword in our code
### 1. Ethic Code
as progammer especially backend developer, we are very related with database which is a storage of important user data. So, we will probably see some importan data of our users. Progammer should keep the privacy right of users. There is many ethic code that progammer community created. as you can see in this below :

### 2. Secure factor
Its our responsibillity as a progammer to maintain our users data in database and keep it to malware and other cyber violance. So, hashing password is one of the answer. We keep our users data. So, our users data cannt be robbed or selling to bad guys.

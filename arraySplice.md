The splice() method adds/removes items to/from an array, and returns the removed item(s).

Note: This method changes the original array.

## Case
imagine that we have weight data(in kilogram) for a group. we put in on the array. Like this
*["60","67","45","50","80","78","73","55"]*

and we code put that to variable *const*
*const weight = ["60","67","45","50","80","78","73","55"];*

so we want to remove

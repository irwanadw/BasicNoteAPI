/**
 * A controller is a collection of function that have responsibilities for:
 * 1. Handling requests that come from routes
 * 2. Do logics based on what route or queries that client requests
 *
 * We can see the benefits of the controller, some of them are
 * 1. Centralized import, we can see that we import jwtHelper.js in one file, it saves memory
 * by just declaring less variable
 * 2. Easier handling, sometimes we will use the same function in both route, by using controller
 * we can modularize that function without creating a new file

/**
 * A controller is a collection of function that have responsibilities for:
 * 1. Handling requests that come from routes
 * 2. Do logics based on what route or queries that client requests
 *
 * We can see the benefits of the controller, some of them are
 * 1. Centralized import, we can see that we import jwtHelper.js in one file, it saves memory
 * by just declaring less variable
 * 2. Easier handling, sometimes we will use the same function in both route, by using controller
 * we can modularize that function without creating a new file

  /**
   * Underscored method name usually means that the method is used
   * only for internal method, this concept is called "OOP Encapculation"
   * which makes any methods or property belongs (or in OOP its called "private")
   * to the class, not to the code who use this class (or in OOP is called "public").
   * 
   * Just remember that we can still use this method outside of this class
   * by just typing it's name which not makes it "private", that's because
   * Javascript isn't really a programming language designed to do OOP, that's
   * why people who want to use OOP in Javascript agrees this as "convention"
   * rather than a real private method.
   * 
   * More on that at ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/issues/703#issuecomment-202557952
   * 
   * Q: Can we just declare this method outside of this class as function,
   * and make class method use the function?
   * A: Yes, but it will be a big hassle if we want to change something,
   * because we will need to constantly scroll outside & inside the class to make
   * changes.
